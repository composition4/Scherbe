## Introduction ##
> To avoid the loss of lives and to prevent sickness caused by ionization
> of organic materials, exploration of the disaster site is accomplished via
> virtual reality technology, which will allow you to control your remote
> exploration unit.
>
> In your tour simulation, your remote exploration unit will include the
> following tools:
> * __Compass__ - device which allows the subject certain spatial orientation.
> * __Chronometer__ - device which allows the subject certain time orientation.
> * __Multimeter__ - device which displays lectures of several relevant environmental parameters.
> * __Omnitool__ - device which allows manipulation of other devices subject may encounter at the disaster site
>
> In cases of extreme emergency, you can press the large red "Escape"
> button to eject you from the neural connection to your remote exploration
> unit.
>
> Please read the accompanying User Guide for further features and functions
> you can perform on the remote exploration unit!

## Brainstorm! ##
* Two (2) tour announcers:
    * Marketing / commercial style voice (deep, strong)
    * AI / computer voice (high pitch / register, feminine)
