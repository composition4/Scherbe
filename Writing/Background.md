# Background #

Around the year 2050, quantum computing had finally reached a state where quantum supercomputers
capable of running at 4096 qubits were possible. Primitive artificial intelligences were starting
to give way to the newer generation of generalized intelligences. Humanity began solving the really
hard problems.

Scientists were now looking into the hard question of the cosmological concept of a holographic universe
by creating a simulated universe program run parallel between multiple universe timelines. Things were going
well, but the simulation was still as of yet incomplete. Newly added test code was added to the simulation's
modular design, adding the concept of multiverses to the simulated holographic universe itself. The code wsan't
fully tested; it was only meant to run for a short moment while the universe was in its first tenets of creation
and then spun down.

That spin down never occurred. The introduction of multiverses into the equations created a form of divide by zero
error, a quantum entanglement, with parralel timeline universes running the same simulation. However, as with divide by zero
errors with the older electron systems, the quantum systems weren't designd to handle this new type of cascading
effect. 

In other universes of the multiverse, those measures had been put in place, the code had undergone rigorous testing
beforehand and the cascading recursion problem was fixed with a simple iteration counter.
The consequences were hazardous for those involved universes that hadn't.

The separate universes had collided in a sense, with each involved timeline creating a cauterization in the fixed
space-time coordinate of the surrounding area. The multiverse had reacted with a natural mechanism to cauterize
the offending wound caused by this entanglement, preventing other portions of the time-space of those involved
to continue living; the universes, and ultimately the multiverse, had acted immulologically.

This of course posed more questions as to the nature of how the multiverse worked, or how the quantum cosmologists of
the time viewed the mechanics of their reality. Pending cross-timeline communications with the quantum communications
of their time, a scientific quorum was formed. That lead to a scientific team to bridge into this cauterized space-time
zone.

You are on that team.
